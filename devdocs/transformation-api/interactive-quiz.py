        "question": "In LLVM IR, what must every basic block end with?",
        "options": [
            "A return instruction",
            "A terminator instruction (br, ret, switch, etc.)",
            "A call instruction",
            "Nothing special - it's just the last instruction",
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "Every basic block must end with exactly one terminator instruction. "
        "This is invariant in LLVM IR. Terminators define control flow: where "
        "execution can go next. Without a terminator, LLVM wouldn't know what "
        "happens after the block.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What does SSA (Static Single Assignment) mean in practice?",
        "options": [
            "Each variable can only be read once",
            "Each value can only be assigned once",
            "Each function can only have one return",
            "Each block can only have one predecessor",
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "SSA means every value is defined exactly once. You can't reassign: "
        "%x = add i32 1, 2; %x = add i32 %x, 3 is INVALID. "
        "Instead, use new names: %x = ...; %y = add i32 %x, 3. "
        "This enables powerful optimizations because the compiler knows "
        "exactly where each value comes from.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What's a PHI node used for?",
        "options": [
            "Representing function parameters",
            "Selecting a value based on which predecessor block we came from",
            "Performing floating-point operations",
            "Calling external functions",
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "PHI nodes exist because of SSA + control flow. When two blocks merge, "
        "and each defines a different version of a value, how do we pick? "
        "PHI nodes: %result = phi i32 [ %x, %block1 ], [ %y, %block2 ]. "
        "The value depends on which predecessor we came from. "
        "They're crucial for loops and conditionals.",

            "str (string type)",
        ],
        "correct": 4,
        "explanation": "LLVM has no native string type. Strings are represented as arrays of i8 "
        "([13 x i8]) or pointers to i8 (ptr). i1 is valid (booleans), i32 is valid "
        "(common integer), and ptr is the opaque pointer type in modern LLVM.",

BINDING_API = [

        ],
        "correct": 3,
        "explanation": "The two-step process is error-prone! If you call delete_instruction() "
        "while the instruction is still in a block, LLVM will assert/crash. "
        "The plan proposes adding erase_from_parent() that does both atomically, "
        "matching the C++ API.",

            "Copies the value to all users",
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "RAUW is fundamental to SSA-based transformations. When you create a new "
        "value that should replace an old one, you use RAUW to update every "
        "instruction that uses the old value. This is NOT currently bound - "
        "the passes implement it manually, which is error-prone and slow.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if you access a Module after exiting its 'with' block?",
        "options": [
            "You get garbage data",
            "Python segfaults",
            "You get a clean Python exception (due to validity tokens)",
            "Nothing - the module is copied",
        ],
        "correct": 3,
        "explanation": "The bindings use 'validity tokens' to track object lifetime. When the "
        "context manager exits, the underlying LLVM object is disposed, and "
        "all Python wrappers are marked invalid. Accessing them raises a clean "
        "exception instead of the undefined behavior you'd get in C++.",
    },
    {
        "question": "To iterate over an instruction's operands, you use:",
        "options": [
            "for op in inst.operands:",
            "for op in inst.get_operands():",
            "for i in range(inst.num_operands): op = inst.get_operand(i)",
            "for op in inst:",
        ],
        "correct": 3,
        "explanation": "There's no .operands iterator! This is listed as a missing convenience. "
        "You must use index-based access. The plan proposes adding an operands "
        "property that returns an iterator for Pythonic access.",
    },
]

OBFUSCATION = [
    {
        "question": "The MBA substitution X - Y = (X ^ -Y) + 2*(X & -Y) works because:",
        "options": [
            "XOR always equals subtraction",
            "It exploits the relationship between arithmetic and bitwise operations in two's complement",
            "It's an approximation that's close enough",
            "The extra operations cancel out",
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "In two's complement representation, there are deep connections between "
        "arithmetic and bitwise operations. The identity is exact for all inputs "
        "in fixed-width integers. The obfuscation works because decompilers "
        "pattern-match 'sub' to '-', but don't recognize this equivalent form.",
    },
    {
        "question": "Control flow flattening hides the original CFG by:",
        "options": [
            "Encrypting all instructions",
            "Introducing a state machine dispatcher that controls block execution",
            "Removing all branches",
            "Inlining all functions",
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "CFF creates a dispatcher that reads a state variable and branches to "
        "the appropriate block. Each block updates the state and jumps back to "
        "the dispatcher. The original 'if A then B else C' structure becomes "
        "'switch(state) { ... }' - much harder to analyze.",
    },
    {
        "question": "Why does the CFF pass demote PHI nodes to stack variables?",
        "options": [
            "PHI nodes are too slow",
            "PHI nodes encode predecessor information that's lost after flattening",
            "The LLVM API doesn't support PHI nodes",
            "Stack variables are more secure",
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "PHI nodes say 'if we came from block1, use %x; if from block2, use %y'. "
        "After flattening, we always come from the dispatcher! The predecessor "
        "information is meaningless. By converting to explicit memory operations, "
        "we preserve the semantics without relying on control flow.",
    },
    {
        "question": "The string encryption pass was abandoned because:",
        "options": [
            "Strings can't be encrypted",
            "The bindings encode strings as UTF-8, corrupting bytes > 127",
            "LLVM doesn't support string constants",
            "It was too slow",
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "const_string() and const_data_array() pass strings through UTF-8 encoding. "
        "Encrypted bytes often exceed 127, which expand to multi-byte UTF-8 "
        "sequences. The resulting array is larger than expected, breaking the "
        "decryption logic. This is listed as a critical blocker in the plan.",
    },
]

CRITIQUE = [
    {
        "question": "Which improvement has the HIGHEST priority according to the plan?",
        "options": [

            "Making ptr a property instead of method",
            "Binding LLVMReplaceAllUsesWith",
            "Adding an .operands iterator",
        ],
        "correct": 3,
        "explanation": "The plan categorizes issues by priority. Priority 1 (Critical Blockers) "
        "includes RAUW, erase_from_parent, split_basic_block, and raw bytes support. "
        "These block real use cases. API consistency issues (like ptr()) are P2, "
        "conveniences are P3, documentation is P4.",
    },
    {
        "question": "The porting guide rates the API '7/10 for code generation, 5/10 for transforms'. Why the difference?",
        "options": [
            "Transforms are inherently harder",
            "The Builder API is good, but operations like RAUW and block splitting are missing",
            "Python is slow for transforms",
            "The documentation is better for code generation",
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "Code generation (creating new IR) mainly uses the Builder, which is "
        "well-designed (add, sub, br, etc.). Transforms (modifying existing IR) "
        "need operations like replace_all_uses_with, erase_from_parent, split_block. "
        "These are missing or cumbersome, making transform work painful.",

            "The API should fail loudly on errors",

            "The API should be minimal",
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "A 'pit of success' API design makes it hard to do the wrong thing. "
        "The current two-step instruction deletion violates this - the natural "
        "thing (just call delete) crashes. A good API would make the safe path "
        "the obvious path: inst.erase_from_parent() does everything correctly.",
